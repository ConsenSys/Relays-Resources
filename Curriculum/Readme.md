*A note about the recommended timebox: Some of these activities should be occurring asynchronously. Some members of the team should be working on one section, where others should be focused on other areas. The timeboxes are meant more as rough guidelines as opposed to hard-and-fast rules. ðŸ˜Š*

## So what is this exactly?
**Focus** is the hardest thing to maintain in any creative endeavor. There are literally thousands of things you could be doing for your project at any given moment, but only a handful of activities that actually get you closer to your end-goal.

The purpose of this start-up kit is make those handful of tasks simple to focus on.

All of the resources, templates, and reading we provide are organized across the 15-days Hackathon. This is a relatively simple, hard-to-miss-or-misread roadmap for every team to gauge their progress against.


## Before we even get started...

### What's Your Goal for this Hackathon?
There are a lot of reasons to participate in a hackathon, especially a decentralized hackathon like a Relay.

Generally, the reasons fall into three buckets:

1. I want to start a company.
2. I want to meet a co-founder
3. I want practice building a product from scratch.

Take some time to answer that question for yourself. What are you looking to get out of this Hackathon? Once you know that, you can find others via Discord or the GC Team Channel to find likeminded people.


## What Should You Know Before Starting...

A Relay hackathon is a little different than a regular hackathon. On top of being longer, and distributed, the focus of the projects themselves are different. It's not just about code in a Relay, it's about user research, team-fit, product, market, etc. But ultimately, all of those things are boiled down to two things: *traction* and *potential.*

What do you need to build in order to validate the traction and potential of an idea? That's up to each individual team. We provide an example judge's scorecard though, so you can get an idea of how we ask the judges to assess the Relay entries.
