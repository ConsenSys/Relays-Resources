[MONTH]  XX, 20XX

## Research Questions

These are the questions that will shape the development of the moderator guide, the targeting for recruiting, and ultimately, the product itself. 

Top line question is: XX

**EXAMPLES**

- What is the biggest problem facing customers in XYZ vertical?

Write this research question to be your own: [https://library.royalroads.ca/writing-centre/writing/structure/thesis-statements](https://library.royalroads.ca/writing-centre/writing/structure/thesis-statements)


Next use the sub-questions to ladder up to the main research question. These usually aren't at the granularity yet that a user can answer them; that's OK. It's going to help us write the guide itself.

- XX
- XX
- XX

**EXAMPLES**

- How are users solving this problem currently?
- How often are they faced with this problem?
- What are the biggest factors impacting people with this problem?
- What does XYZ solution look like now? What are the discrete steps?
- How would their behavior change if a better solution existed? 

**General flow:**

1. Getting to know you: tell me about yourself
2. [OPEN ENDED INTERVIEW GUIDE]
3. [EVALUATIVE RESEARCH IF NEEDED - SHOW AND TELL OR PROTOTYPE]
4. Thank you and follow up study requests


## User Research Script

Hi there. Thank you for making time to chat with us today. My name is [XXXX] and we’re here to chat about your experience as a [ACTOR  ROLE]. Just to be sure we have the right person, you do have experience [DOING WHAT WE’RE STUDYING] right?

Our discussion today will last approximately [HOWEVER MANY] minutes. Just to make sure that we don’t miss anything and that everyone has the same context, I may ask you questions that we’ve already discussed via email or phone in preparation for this interview. 

There may be other people attending the call today, but they’re listening in the background and will only ask questions if they still have them at the end. To minimize the need to take thorough notes on this call, is it OK with you if we record our conversation today? 


If you have any questions for me, feel free to let me know and we can stop at any time. 

Do you have any questions before we begin?

1. Great. Let’s start with some simple getting-to-know-you questions. 
    1. Tell me about yourself -- what’s your day job?
        1. XX

    2. How did you get started [DOING WHAT WE’RE STUDYING]?

*NOTE: The below is an example research guide for a contextual study done with crypto-miners and is included below for example use only. Your study should look very different from this.*


> “This is where you're going to start asking the open-ended questions you have for the participants. Remember, you should NOT be asking Yes/No questions during this time and should always be able to dig in to any question you ask them with the 5 Why's if you need to. e.g: "how do you finance buying new hardware?" when they give you the answer, you can ask: why do you do it that way? (as in, what other financial options did you have that you turned down to finance hardware this way?)”
*-- Katie Johnson*

> “I always take verbatim notes when I do interviews just so I don't miss anything (even if I'm recording) so I leave placeholders for me to type. Another way I've done this in the past is using google forms, which acts as a script for me and allows me to take notes and store them in an excel file.”

“This is where you can transition to showing them a prototype or telling them about a value prop (if you don't have a prototype) to get feedback. Basically, if you want to get some evaluative feedback during your interview, now is the time.”


1. That’s it for the questions on our side. I’d like to take this opportunity to tell you briefly about what we’re working on here. 
    1. [Value Prop]: We're building [COMPANY], which allows you to [VALUE PROPOSITION]. With [COMPANY], we enable you to [DO WHATEVER]. For example, you would be able to [DO X and GET Y]. This means [MORE VALUE PROP!].
