# Step 05 - Write Your Pitch

This is the home stretch. Great work doesn't speak for itself, it needs the team behind it front and center, telling the story of the product and the people it's going to help. There are, thankfully, a *ton* of resources out there for teams who are pitching for the first time. Relays makes things a little easier in that it's async, but it's also more difficult. The team needs to create an artifact (or series of artifacts) that tell the story of your project on it's own. 

## "How do I Know I'm Done?"

Some outputs of this section are...

* A pitch deck
* A short video of your pitch and a demo of your Product
* Video testimonials and user Testing
* A `submission.md` correctly filled out (**non-negotiable**)
* A folder submitted as a pull-request to the primary Relays repo containing all work (code, notes, research, etc)
